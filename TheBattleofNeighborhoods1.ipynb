    "London is a multi-cultural city, characterized by several neighborhoods, each one with an history and populated by different ethnic groups. Among the others, the Italian population is one of the most numerous, and the Italian cuisine is one of the most appreciated.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we would like to understand, with a data-driven approach, what neighborhoods offers the highest business opportunities if a new Italian restaurant is opened. Specifically we would like to answer the following question: if someone is looking to open an italian restaurant, where would they open it? \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to answer this question, we perform a segmentation and clusterization of the city based on its neighborhoods. This allows us to analyse the distribution of Italian restaurants in London, and thus to obtain the areas where this business is still in a preliminary stage.  "
